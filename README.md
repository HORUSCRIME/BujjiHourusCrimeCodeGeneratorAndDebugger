Excited to share a project that's supercharging developer productivity!

I've been building the HorusCrime Code Assistant, an AI-powered tool designed to streamline code generation and debugging. This project is a significant step towards making development workflows even more efficient and intuitive.

What it does:

1.Code Generation: 

 Simply provide a prompt, and the AI generates relevant code snippets.
 
2.Intelligent Debugging:

 Input your buggy code (and optionally an error message), and the assistant provides insights and suggestions for fixes.
 

Under the Hood:

1.Frontend: Crafted with React, offering a sleek and responsive user interface.

2.Backend: Powered by Flask, handling the logic and API integrations.

3.AI Engine: Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Google Gemini API to deliver intelligent code understanding and generation.

This project demonstrates how modern AI can be seamlessly integrated into developer tools to enhance efficiency and reduce development cycles. It's incredibly rewarding to see these pieces come together to create something truly useful!
